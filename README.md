Service Worker Toolchain
=========================

[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/5c0140da798a3ec1f2fda2019d15ab3f62c3d859815c7d97ec.svg?branch=master)](https://buildkite.com/pinterest/service-workers)


A collection of service worker generation tools.
Configurable and forkable.

## Includes the following packages

### [generate-service-worker](https://github.com/pinterest/service-workers/tree/master/packages/generate-service-worker)
A node module for generating service worker files based on provided configuration options.

### [service-worker-plugin](https://github.com/pinterest/service-workers/tree/master/packages/service-worker-plugin)
A webpack plugin for generating dynamic service worker files and a runtime helper.

### [service-worker-mock](https://github.com/pinterest/service-workers/tree/master/packages/service-worker-mock)
A mock service worker environment generator. Used for testing service worker code.

## Why?
There are several other packages that generate service workers ([sw-precache](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache), [offline-plugin](https://github.com/NekR/offline-plugin/), etc). This collection of tools was built to allow more complexity while being fully testable, and allowing the generation of multiple service worker files simultaneously for experimentation/rollout. We chose not to use a templating language, but to instead inject globals into the scripts so that our "templates" were pure JavaScript. This makes it easier to test/read/update the code, with the downside of slightly larger output sizes. See the README in each package for more details.

We encourage forking of the base templates found in [packages/generate-service-worker/templates/](https://github.com/pinterest/service-workers/tree/master/packages/generate-service-worker/templates).


## Contributing

scripts        | description
-------------- | -----------
`yarn install` | install all dev dependencies
`yarn test`    | run the test suite
`yarn run lint`| run eslint
`yarn start`   | run the demo for development testing

To get started contributing, run `yarn start`, which will run a webpack-devserver on `localhost:3000`. In `demo/webpack.config.js` you'll see the configurations used for the demo testing. Each experimental config can be accessed via the `key` query param (i.e. `localhost:3000?key=withNotifications`). This provides a simple way to install a new service worker for testing, and the corresponding generated code will be visible in the DOM itself thanks to [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/). Use the `application` tab in the devtools to verify that the service worker was installed. By setting `debug: true` in the plugin config, the devtools console can be used to verify actions are taking place.
